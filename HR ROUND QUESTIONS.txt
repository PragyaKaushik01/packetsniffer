About Family
I have five members in my family including me.
My father is a farmer and my mother is  a home maker. 
& i have two siblings.

Strength --> Flexibility. Dedication. Positive Attitude. Creativity. Leadership. Determination.
Weakness --> i can trust on people easily.

I would like to rate myself an 8. 8 because I know that I am not perfect and there is always a scope
 for learning and improvement. Continuous learning is the most fundamental part of personal and 
professional growth

in ur company and make a good relationship with all office member and staff

i try to find my fault and rectify it and again apply on better position in ur company
